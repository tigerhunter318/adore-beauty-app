Proper hydration can make a massive difference in the look and feel of your complexion. The Ordinary has developed one of the best Hyaluronic Acid treatments for an instant hydration boost and easy absorption. Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 has quickly become one of the brand’s most-loved products. Because it benefits all skin types, this serum is a must-have in anyone’s skincare cabinet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/the-ordinary/guide/how-do-i-use-hyaluronic-acid-and-why-do-i-need-it\" target=\"_blank\">Key benefits of The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5</a></h2><ul><li>Instant hydration for skin</li><li>Suitable for all skin types, including oily skin, due to its easy absorption and weightless texture</li><li>Enriched with Vitamin B5 to boost surface hydration</li><li>Uses multiple molecular weights of Hyaluronic Acid for multi-depth hydration</li><li>Non-comedogenic formulation</li><li>60ml</li><li><a href=\"https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/the-ordinary/the-ordinary-hyaluronic-acid-2-b5-30ml.html\" target=\"_blank\">Also available in a 30mL size</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Hyaluronic Acid?</h2><p><br>Hyaluronic Acid is a molecule that naturally occurs in the body and is known for its incredible water-retention properties. One single molecule can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water. When applied as part of a skincare routine, Hyaluronic Acid provides instant hydration to plump and nourish the skin</p><h2><br>How does The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 work?</h2><p><br>The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 is a water-based formula that blends three different weights of Hyaluronic Acid with a Hyaluronic Acid Crosspolymer to provide multi-depth hydration. This means the serum not only helps to hydrate the deeper layers of the skin but also locks in existing moisture and absorbs easily into the skin. This product is enriched with additional Vitamin B5, which boosts surface hydration and supports the work of the Hyaluronic Acid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Who should use The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5?</h2><p>Due to its lightweight texture, this Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin B5 serum can be beneficial for all skin types, even those with oily but dehydrated skin. This serum from The Ordinary suits anyone who is looking to plump their dry, dehydrated, or damaged complexion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><br>What is Vitamin B5, and how does it work with Hyaluronic Acid?</h2><p><br>Vitamin B5, otherwise known as Pantothenic Acid, is a naturally occurring vitamin that helps to increase the surface hydration levels of the skin. It works as a natural moisturiser, allowing the skin to easily absorb moisture from the air, keeping your face soft and hydrated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vitamin B5 works extremely well at supporting the work of Hyaluronic Acid. This vitamin allows the acid to penetrate and moisturise the deeper layers of the skin, ensuring full-thickness hydration. The combination of the two ingredients makes this serum from The Ordinary one of the best moisture-boosting products available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Is The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 good for acne?</h2><p><br>Whilst the Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid serum has not been developed specifically to treat or heal acne, it will help hydrate skin during or after a breakout.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Is The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 good for scars/pigmentation?</h2><p><br>The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 does not treat scarring and pigmentation when used alone. However, it will support a routine to reduce scarring over time and help to plump up the skin for a healthier look and feel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Is The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 good for rosacea?</h2><p><br>The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 is excellent for helping to hydrate and repair rosacea-prone skin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Is The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 comedogenic?</h2><p>The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 is non-comedogenic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Is The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 good for wrinkles?</h2><p><br>Dehydration and dryness can emphasise the look and depth of fine lines and wrinkles. By using The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, you can make your complexion look plumper and minimise the appearance of facial lines. Whilst this serum will not reverse the signs of premature ageing, it works well in conjunction with other anti-ageing products and helps to rehydrate skin as it becomes older and drier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All of our products are filled/measured by weight/volume so the product is correctly filled to 30 ml. The packaging does not accurately reflect the size of the fill. However, this is intentional as some air must be allowed at the top for the product to actually close.</p>",

    "howToUse": "After cleansing your face and applying your desired serums and/or exfoliators, take a blueberry sized amount onto clean fingers, and smooth over the face using upwards, stroking motions. Take care to avoid the eye area, but take down the neck and over the decolletage area. For extra dry skin, follow with an oil, or alternatively, add a few drops of oil to this product before smoothing over the face. As this product doesn't contain an SPF, we recommend layering with an SPF 30+ for adequate protection from the sun if wearing during the day. \nSuitable for use morning and evening. ",

    "description": "<h2>Bigger size, best value, better for the environment.</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now available in double the size, Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% is a bestselling serum from the skincare experts at The Ordinary. Developed to help clear congested complexions and minimise the appearance and severity of blemishes, Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% is a must-have for oily and acne-prone skin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This high-performance treatment, which is enriched with vitamins and minerals, can help to transform the texture of uneven skin. The serum also helps other treatments to work more effectively for a clearer and less-congested complexion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Key benefits of The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%</h2><ul><li>High-strength serum for skincare congestion</li><li>Can be used as part of an anti-acne skincare routine</li><li>Helps to balance sebum levels</li><li>Oil-free and non-comedogenic formulation</li><li>60ml</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><h2><a href=\"https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/the-ordinary/guide/the-ordinary-niacinamide-serum-what-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">How does The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% work?</a></h2><p>Niacinamide, otherwise known as Vitamin B3, and Zinc are naturally occurring substances in the body. These ingredients are useful in a skincare routine to decongest skin and balance sebum levels. The combination of these two potent ingredients helps to battle blemishes by reducing bacteria on the skin, regulating oil production, and minimising the appearance of pores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Niacinamide improves the skin’s moisture-retention abilities whilst boosting the skin’s natural defense system. Zinc repairs skin damaged by acne and congestion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The high concentrations of both Niacinamide and Zinc in this powerful serum from The Ordinary help to quickly clear up complexions and calm any breakouts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% suitable for?</h2><p>The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% is best for those with oily and acne-prone skin. This healing serum can help reduce the severity and frequency of breakouts whilst balancing oil levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><br>What is the difference between The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% and a retinol or salicylic acid treatment for treating acne?</h2><p>Although The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% contains a combination of powerful ingredients, it can help clear congested skin more gently than both retinol and salicylic acid can. Those with sensitive skin should be cautious when applying retinol and salicylic acid, as they can cause irritation and sensitivity. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% does not come with these same potential side effects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Retinol and salicylic acid work as peels on the skin, removing a layer of damaged and acne-prone skin cells to reveal a fresher and clearer complexion below. These two ingredients should be used sparingly and introduced into a skincare routine slowly. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% does not work in the same way, as it simply decongests skin and prevents future breakouts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Is The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% good for acne?</h2><p><br>The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% is an excellent treatment product for clearing up acne, as the serum helps to reduce the severity and frequency of breakouts by banishing blemish-forming bacteria. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% also helps to balance sebum production and minimise enlarged pores. All of these actions can dramatically improve the appearance of acne-prone skin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Is The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% good for scarring and pigmentation?</h2><p>The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% can assist in reducing the appearance and severity of scarring and pigmentation. To help with scarring and pigmentation, Niacinamide is best used in a skincare routine alongside vitamin C and retinol.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Is The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% good for rosacea?</h2><p><br>Rosacea most commonly affects dry and dehydrated skin, so this serum is not recommended as a rosacea treatment. However, if you have an oily or congested complexion that is prone to rosacea, this product can be used to help balance sebum levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Is The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% comedogenic?</h2><p>The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% has been developed to help clear congested skin and is non-comedogenic. It is also oil-free, vegan, and cruelty-free.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Is The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% good for wrinkles?</h2><p><br>The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% has not been designed to improve ageing skin or wrinkles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All of our products are filled/measured by weight/volume so the product is correctly filled to 60 ml. The packaging does not accurately reflect the size of the fill. However, this is intentional as some air must be allowed at the top for the product to actually close.</p>",
    "howToUse": "The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% is a powerful water-based serum that should be introduced carefully into a skincare routine. It can be used once, or twice daily depending on preference and is suitable for morning and/or night use. Apply before moisturiser and oil treatments. If you are also using a Vitamin-C-based serum, the Niacinamide and Zinc serum should be applied at the opposite time of day. So if you use vitamin C in the morning, use Niacinamide and Zinc in the evening, as the two can interact negatively with each other.\n\n",
